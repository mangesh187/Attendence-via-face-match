# Attendence-via-face-match
## Problem Statment
You are working for a company XYZ which has decided to automate the attendance capturing system using only the picture of the employee (selfie). However, XYZ company only has one or two passport size photographs of their employees in the system for reference.
Your task is to design this image based attendance capturing system using any
machine learning or computer vision approach. The system has to match an employee's selfie with the passport size photograph and output either its a match or no match.
Make sure to include your own selfies and passport size picture in the training data. Note that the images with 'script' in their name are the passport size images images or reference images which are present in the company's system.
